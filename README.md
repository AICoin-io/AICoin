# AICoin (beta)
This repository contains the Solidity code that will be used to create the AICoin.

## TEST-NET
The beta version of the code exists already as a smart contract on the Ethereum Test-Net (Ropsten). To add this to your own contracts page, you can use the address and ABI code that are in files unde the contracts folder of this repository.

## Peer review
The contract deployed was compiled with version 0.4.11+commit.68ef5810 of the solidity compiler. Peer review of the solidity code is welcomed.

## Javascript interface
The contract code has been kept intentionally simple, and a javascript library is being developed to provide higher-level access to the contract information.
